# Guardrails for column selection when applying functions

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of guardrails is to create feature-rich wrappers for custom data analysis functions. Users can specify [tidy selections](https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/reference/language.html) which the functions will follow by default, out of the box.

This package is under development. It's currently lacking in documentation.

## Installation

You can install the development version of guardrails from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("lhdjung/guardrails")
```
